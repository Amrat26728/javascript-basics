<!-- what is object?
     javasript is OOP programming language, so everything in javascript is object.
     A javascript object is like a real-world entity having state and behaviour.
     e.g: car (state: color, model and behaviour: accelerating etc).
     javascript is template based and we can create objects without the need of having a class. -->

<!-- Object properties:
     a javascript object is basically a collection of unordered properties.
     values associated with a javascript object are called its peoperties.
     properties can usually be accessd, added, updated and deleted excluding read only properties. -->

<!-- object methods:
     a javascript method is an action that can be performed on the objects. -->

<!-- object accessors:
     getters and setters allow defining of object accessors.
     getter is used to get the value of the properties of an object.
     setter is use to set the value of the properties of an object. -->

     // Three ways of creating javascript objects.

     // first way of creating object.
     // use object literal to create and define a javascript object.
     var student = {
          name: "Amrat",
          age: 22,
          studies: "Software Engineering"
     };
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = student.name + " of the age " + student.age + " studies " + student.studies;

     // second way of creating object.
     // use the keyword new to create an define a javascript object.
     var student = new Object();
     student.name = "Noman",
     student.age = 21,
     student.studies = "Software Engineering";
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = student.name + " of age " + student.age + " studies " + student.studies;

     // third way to create object.
     // use an object constructor to create and define a javascript object.
     function student_data(name, age, studies){
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
          this.studies = studies;

     var student = new student_data("Airaf", 22, "Software Engineering");
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = student.name + " of age " + student.age + " studies " + student.studies;

     // accessing properties:
     var student_data = {
          name: "Ibad",
          age: 22,
          studies: "Software Engineering"
     };
     // x = student_data.age;
     y = "age";
     // document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = student_data.name + " of age " + student_data.age + " studies " + student_data.studies;
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = student_data.name + " of age " + student_data[y] + " studies " + student_data.studies;

     // object methods:
     let user = {
          name: "Ali",
          age: 22
     };
     function sayHi(){
          alert("Hello!");
     }
     user.message = sayHi
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hi " + user.name;
     document.getElementById("click-me").onclick = user.message;

     // object accessors:
     var car = {
          model: "320d",
          color: "white",
          fuel_type: "deisel",
          car_name: "",
          set name(name){
               this.car_name = name;
          },
          get fuel(){
               return this.fuel_type;
          }
     }
     car.name = "civic";
